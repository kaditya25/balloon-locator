This repository will store images that you can use to test your balloon locator
code.

Download the `easy-ones` image set as follows:
```
cd ~/Workspace/lab5-aerial-robotics/images
# Don't miss the trailing period at the end of the line below.  This tells wget
# to store the images in the current directory.
wget http://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/datastore/aerialRobotics/easy-ones.tar .
tar xf easy-ones.tar
```
